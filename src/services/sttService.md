# src/services/sttService.ts

## Responsibilities:
- Convert audio recorded by the broker into text.
- Integration with external STT services (Deepgram, AssemblyAI).
- Support for speaker diarization (differentiating between broker and client).

## Current Status:
- Stubbed for now, returns a mock transcript.
- Future: Will implement API calls to a robust STT provider.
