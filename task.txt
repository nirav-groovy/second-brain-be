We have to develop a "AI Meeting Memory + Deal Intelligence" product for brokers.
we are building a decision-support system for deal closing.
Below is a practical, production-grade roadmap (not theory).

1. Clearly Define the Product

The app automatically converts real estate conversations into structured deal intelligence.
The output must not be transcript.
The output must be actionable broker insight
Structured Output (THIS is out MVP deliverable)

after completing meeting the app should generate (basically a Customer Relation Manager)

ex. 
Client Profile
    Budget range
    Loan requirement
    Family size
    Urgency (immediate / 3 months / investment only)
Interest Signals
    2BHK vs 3BHK preference
    Floor preference
    Vastu importance
    Location priority
    Parking requirement
Financial Intelligence
    Expected rent
    Builder scheme
    Negotiation possibility
    Discount probability
    Holding period

Deal Probability Score
(AI should literally say: 65% closing chance)

You are a sales weapon for the broker

2) How the App Actually Works (Architecture)

Broker opens app → 
    Register/Login in the app
    taps Start Visit Mode
    We will ask for basic details ex. title of meeting
    App records conversation
    Stops recording
    Converts speech → text
    AI understands discussion
    AI extracts structured information
    Broker receives summarized deal sheet

3) System Architecture
You do NOT send raw audio to GPT directly.
Pipeline:
Audio → Speech-to-Text → AI Understanding → Structured Summary → CRM Card

4) Technology Stack (Recommended)
    1. Speech-to-Text (MOST CRITICAL DECISION)
        Use: Deepgram or AssemblyAI
        Because meeting can be in multiple language & also can be in mixed language

        You must enable:
        Speaker Diarization (So AI knows: builder spoke vs client spoke)
        This is extremely important because: Builder promise ≠ Client requirement
    2. AI Understanding Layer
        OpenAI GPT-4.1 / GPT-4o mini / gemini for extraction
        But DO NOT ask: “Summarize this conversation”
        Instead use: information extraction prompting
        You will send transcript and ask AI: "Extract budget, urgency, unit preference, financing requirement, objections, risk factors and builder commitments. Return strict JSON."
        This is key: we are building a conversation intelligence engine.
    3. Structured Database (Most founders miss this)
        we need to store:
            Client profile
            Property interest
            Builder promises
            Next follow-up date
        use MongoDB.
        Later we will have: “Show me all clients looking for 3BHK under ₹90L in Shela”
        Now you are not an app. You are a lead intelligence CRM.
    4. Auto Follow-Up Reminder
        AI should automatically generate: “Call after 5 days — client waiting for bank approval"
    5. Objection Detection
        Price too high
        Wife not convinced
        Loan eligibility doubt
    6. Builder Comparison
        AI automatically compares projects discussed
5) What You Build First
    DO NOT build CRM dashboard initially.
    First:
        1. Create a TODO.MD file where all tasks will be stored, so we will manage tasks from there.
        2. We are Backend, so we have to provide API. FE will be in different project/repo. So here we will do only BE related tasks.
        3. use node express with type script. & create proper folder structure.
            config - where all configs will be stored
            controller - you know 
            middleware - we will validate & check auth.
            modules - all tables will be stored
            routes - you know
            services - we will have logics
            types - you know
            utils - common functions will be stored here
    Build only this:
        Registration & login flow
        FE wil give Recorded meeting
        Generate summary
        Show client card

    That’s it.
    Your MVP screen should show:
    Meeting Summary Card
        Budget: ₹75L–₹85L
        Preference: 3BHK
        Urgency: 2 months
        Loan: Required
        Key Concern: Maintenance cost
        Closing Probability: 58%
        Suggested Action: Share loan options
    If you deliver this reliably → brokers will pay.
